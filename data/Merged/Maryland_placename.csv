Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.The purpose of creating this file was to use MesoMap to create high-resolution wind maps of the state and to provide wind resource data in a format enabling the assessment of potential wind development sites in a GIS. By combining a sophisticated numerical weather model capable of simulating large-scale wind patterns with a microscale wind flow model responsive to local terrain and surface conditions, they enable the mapping of wind resources with much greater accuracy than has been possible in the past. In addition, they do not require surface wind data to make accurate predictions. While on-site measurements will be required to confirm the predicted wind resource at any particular location, mesoscale-microscale modeling can greatly reduce the time and cost required to identify and evaluate potential wind project sites. This map was created by AWS Truepower, LLC using the MesoMap system and historical weather data. Although it is believed to represent an accurate overall picture of the wind energy resource, estimates at any location should be confirmed by measurement.Feature Service Layer Link:https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/UtilityTelecom/MD_OffshoreWindEnergyPlanning/FeatureServer/4",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/01b891ede4c34c828cf77926b40f9973_4,,2016.0,[2016 TO 2016],2016,Public,,English,Offshore Wind Energy Planning - Offshore Wind Roses: Maryland,"{""http://schema.org/url"":""http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/01b891ede4c34c828cf77926b40f9973_4"",""http://schema.org/downloadUrl"":""http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/01b891ede4c34c828cf77926b40f9973_4.zip"",""urn:x-esri:serviceType:ArcGIS#FeatureLayer"":""https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/UtilityTelecom/MD_OffshoreWindEnergyPlanning/FeatureServer/4""}",,,False,Dataset|Service,State of Maryland,"38.015,-74.685",Maryland,"-75.36,37.6,-74.01,38.43",Maryland

Developed primarily as a growth management tool, it has influenced zoning, land-use, and infrustructure decisions, and was the baseline for the Baltimore County part of Maryland's Priority Funding Area. However, this boundary (digitized at a scale of 1:24,000 where 1 represents 2,000') was became obsolete as the county's GIS data increased in resolution (to 1:2,400 where 1 represents 200'). Until recently, determining a property's status as either urban or rural was of a highly interpretative nature. A new URDL was developed to more accurately match the 1:2,400 data (parcel, street centerline, zoning, etc). This version was reviewed and modified in a series of meetings with several interested county agencies. The new URDL removes much of the old one's ambiguity while keeping its original intent. The new URDL was reviewed, modified, and subsequently approved by the Planning Board on June 19, 2003. Minor revisions were effected 9/2/04, 10/21/04, 9/4/07, 5/21/09, 10/1/09 and 11/15/12.
