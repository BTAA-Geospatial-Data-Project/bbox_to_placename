,Condominium Points,"SEMCOG maintains three separate data layers that represent information on built structures in Southeast Michigan: building footprints, building points, and condominium points. The Building Footprints were the first dataset collected. These were originally developed by using heads-up digitizing to trace the outlines of buildings in 2010 aerial photography. This process was repeated later using 2015 and 2019 imagery. Due to differences in spatial accuracy between the 2010 and later imagery sources, footprint polygons delineated using 2010 aerial photography may appear slightly shifted compared with imagery that is more recent. This dataset is current as of April 2019, and contains only three attributes: the unique building identifier, median height and the source of the footprint polygon. The Building Points dataset is a point layer representing a single point, at the center of the structure, for each building in Southeast Michigan as of April 2020. For buildings with an associated footprint polygon, the building point represents the centroid of the polygon. For newer structures, a point is placed at the approximate center of the structure as shown in recent imagery, as no footprint polygon yet exists. Since it is the building points that represent our most current universe of buildings in the region, this is the dataset on which we store the associated attributes of a building, mainly location and physical characteristics obtained from local assessing data and other sources. The Condominium Points dataset is also a point layer, with each point representing an attached condominium unit located within a building. Unlike site condominiums, attached condominiums are by definition only a portion of a single building, but as each unit can be individually owned they need to be tracked independently. To ensure an accurate match between condominium points and the building in which they are located, the condominium points are placed on the building centroid, and do not represent the actual physical location of the unit.Building AttributesAs stated above, SEMCOG maintains building attributes on the building points data layer. The condominium points and building footprints data layers have only a small subset of these attributes.

Square footage evenly divisible by 100 is an estimate, based on size and/or type of building, if the true value is unknown. Building TypesSEMCOG's building types are based on the 2017 North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS). This system classifies establishments based on economic activity, is widely accepted by the planning community, and used by SEMCOG in developing its long-range socioeconomic forecasts. Each of the 22 nonresidential building types represent one or more entire 3-digit NAICS sector groupings, except for five special types of building that do not fit within this system. These specific types of activity (movie theaters, libraries, dormitories, funeral services, and parking garages) have land use and trip generation characteristics that are different from the other types of activity in their respective NAICS sector and are therefore classified individually. More information on NAICS, including descriptions of the economic activity sectors, can be found at the Census Bureau's NAICS web site. There are also four residential building types, which assist us in tracking housing development over time. Residential types are based on a combination of units in structure, and ownership. Single-family homes and site condominiums typically contain only one unit, but there are traditional duplexes where one owner owns both units, that are also classified as single-family. Attached condo buildings contain two or more housing units in a single building, each of which shares one or more walls with an adjoining unit and can be independently owned. Multi-family housing or apartment buildings contain three or more units, all of which are owned by a single entity and intended as rental units. Figure B.1Distribution of Buildings by Type As seen in Figure B.1, 86.9 percent of all buildings are single-family homes, and only 5.8 percent of buildings are of any nonresidential building type.Mobile homes are a special building type, as we do not receive information on changes to mobile homes in a manufactured housing park through the building permits pipeline. We instead maintain a separate layer of points representing individual mobile homes in parks, updated periodically using imagery to denote if a trailer is still present at each point. Pseudo footprints for these points are generated via code and added to the buildings manually.There are structures that SEMCOG does not classify as buildings. To be considered a building, a structure must contain either a housing unit or a minimum of 250 square feet of nonresidential workspace. Therefore, garages, boathouses, and other accessory structures are not classified as buildings. A description of SEMCOG building types, including the relevant NAICS codes for the type, can be found in Table B.2:Table B.2Building Types by NAICS SectorBUILD TYPEDESCRIPTIONNAICS SECTORSRGB11Educational611190-232-25513Religious and Civic8130-132-16814Governmental921-9280-76-11521Retail Building441-454, 811-812255-190-19023Office Building511-551, 561255-0-031Manufacturing311-339194-158-21532Wholesale Trade423-425170-102-20533Warehouse and Storage493112-68-13741Transportation and Utility221, 481-488, 562204-204-20442Delivery Services491-492156-156-15651Health and Social Services621, 624214-157-18852Hospital622245-122-18253Residential Care Facility623137-68-10161Leisure Activity711-713137-205-10263Hotel and Motel721209-255-11565Eating and Drinking72285-255-071Agricultural111-213255-255-081Single-Family HousingResidential255-211-12782Attached Condo BuildingResidential230-152-083Multi-Family ApartmentResidential137-112-6884Mobile HomeResidential137-68-6891Movie Theater51213168-0-092Library519120-197-25593Dormitory Quarters7213192-137-6894Funeral Services81220255-127-12795Parking Garage8129378-78-78The RGB color values match SEMCOG's typical map symbology for building types.Relationship between Buildings LayersCounty land parcel layers are used to assign the unique APN (Assessor Parcel Number), as well as parcel identifier, to each structure located on a parcel by means of spatial intersection between the parcels and buildings layers. However, there are counties which do not represent parcel splits in their parcel layer when large vacant parcels are developed into single-family subdivisions. In these cases, the polygon geometry of the original parent parcel is cloned once for each new child parcel. A geospatial intersection of buildings to parcels in this situation would lead to each building in the subdivision being assigned to whichever parcel polygon happened to be sitting on top of the stack of cloned parcels. In these cases we use other sources, such as building permits and developer site plans, to identify the APN of each new building, and then assign the parcel identifier by finding the land parcel with that APN. Figure B.2Primary Key Relationship of Buildings LayersLand ParcelsBuilding FootprintsBuilding PointsCondominium Pointsparcel_id (unique) ----->parcel_id --------------->parcel_id --------------->parcel_idbuilding_id (unique) --->building_id (unique) --->building_idAPN (unique) ---------->APN -------------------->APN -------------------->APN (unique)condo_id (unique)The APN and parcel identifier are passed to each building on a parcel, with each building assigned a unique building identifier. Since building points are the centroid of building footprints, they share the same building identifier as they reference the same structure. Condominium records are assigned a unique condo identifier, and also the building identifier of the structure they are located within. By this process, each layer has a unique identifier, and can be related to the larger parent geography as needed.Last Update: 01/05/2021",English,Southeast Michigan Council of Governments,State of Michigan,Geospatial data,,Condominiums|BuildingFootprints|Buildings|Condos,2020-06-24T15:39:49.000Z,,,,"Monroe County, Michigan|Wayne County, Michigan|Oakland County, Michigan|Macomb County, Michigan|Michigan","-84.0775,41.7181,-82.4174,43.1329",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a7a87f76d667497e86321812dd18808f_0,https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a7a87f76d667497e86321812dd18808f_0.zip,,https://services1.arcgis.com/xUx8EjNc6egUPYWh/arcgis/rest/services/land_gisview_terra_condos_2020/FeatureServer/0,,a7a87f76d667497e86321812dd18808f_0,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/a7a87f76d667497e86321812dd18808f_0,Michigan State University,06a-01,06a-01,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,False,False

,MDOT SHA Roadway Centerline,"Esri ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Hosted Feature Layer for accessing the MDOT SHA Roadway Centerline data product.MDOT SHA Roadway Centerline data consists of linear geometric features which represent the street centerline for roadways throughout the State of Maryland. The centerline represents the geographic location on the roadway between both shoulders (physical center), which often but not always coincides with the center painted line dividing bi-directional travel lanes. Roadway Centerline data plays an important role in transportation management and planning, while also being the basis for all other roadway-related data products.MDOT SHA Roadway Centerline data is the end product of a statewide data sharing process between the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), county governments and local municipal governments. Using a common centerline allows for better exchange of information related to the roadway system and provides opportunities for more efficient collection of information about roadway assets. Some centerlines were created in-house using imagery, GPS data, and MDOT SHA's Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) database and others were received from county governments and updated in house using imagery, GPS data and MDOT SHA's HPMS database. The Centerline data includes annual HPMS updates / improvements submitted to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).MDOT SHA Roadway Centerline data is needed for emergency response and management, routing buses and other vehicles, planning for land use and transportation needs, continuity of roadway data and display at county boundaries leading to the same ""look and feel"" across jurisdictions, tracking assets on and along the roadway network, producing maps at various scales, and numerous other applications. There are opportunities to make these processes more efficient, and this program addresses a shared foundation to solve some of these issues. This data is also used by various business units throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies.MDOT SHA Roadway Centerline data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2019.Last Updated: July 2020 (07/22/20)For more information about each attribute field, please review theMDOT SHA Roadway Centerline -Data DictionaryFor more information, contact MDOT SHA OIT Enterprise Information Services:Email:GIS@mdot.maryland.gov",English,Maryland SHA,State of Maryland,Geospatial data,,Centerline|Centerlines|RouteCenterline|CenterlineRoutes|RoadCenterline|RoadwayCenterline|MarylandDepartmentofTransportation|MDOT|MarylandDepartmentofTransportationStateHighwayAdministration|MDOTSHA|OfficeoPlanning&PreliminaryEngineering|OPPE|DataServicesDivision|DSD|MDOTSHAOITEnterpriseInformationServices|2019,2020-08-08T00:26:50.000Z,,,,Maryland,"-79.4862,37.9294,-75.0011,39.7331",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/2987f3dfbd834001b60ded2475b50c26_0,https://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/2987f3dfbd834001b60ded2475b50c26_0.zip,,https://services.arcgis.com/njFNhDsUCentVYJW/arcgis/rest/services/MDOT_SHA_Roadway_Centerline/FeatureServer/0,,2987f3dfbd834001b60ded2475b50c26_0,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/2987f3dfbd834001b60ded2475b50c26_0,University of Maryland,04a-01,04a-01,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,False,False
,Maryland Archived Submerged Aquatic Vegetation - SAV 2018,"The 2018 Chesapeake Bay SAV Coverage was mapped from digital multispectral imagery with a 25cm GSD to assess water quality in the Bay. Each area of SAV was interpreted from the rectified imagry and classified into one of four density classes by the percentage of cover. The SAV beds were entered into an SDE GIS fetaure class using the quality control procedures documented below. The dataset contains all SAV areas that were identified from the areas flown. Some areas that are presumed to contain no SAV were not flown. Some small beds, particularly along narrow tributaries may not have been distinguishable on the aerial photography.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, seeAccuracy of the Data). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.Data Processing Notes:This layer is updated automatically when the most current vintage of ACS data is released each year, usually in December.

,Threatened and Endangered Species Ranges,"This data is showing the current ranges in Nebraska for the species listed as threatened or endangered in the state. This version supersedes all previously dated versions. Updates are made to the shapefile as new information becomes available, and periodically updated maps are posted to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission website. A range map is a generalized representation of the distribution of a species. A species might occur anywhere within a mapped range in which there is suitable habitat. These maps show current ranges rather than historical ranges. Thus an area in which a given species formerly occurred is not included if there is a high degree of confidence on the part of NGPC biologists that the species no longer occurs there. Species, particularly those highly mobile such as birds, may occur outside of their range in locations in which the species is generally described as 'accidental' or 'vagrant.' Range maps do not include such locations. Species may also occur outside the range if the range has changed since the time it was last updated.",English,State of Nebraska,State of Nebraska,Geospatial data,,Biota|Nebraska|SpeciesRanges|At-Risk,2020-12-31T17:44:00.000Z,,,,Nebraska,"-104.2273,39.8910,-95.0993,43.1123",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://www.nebraskamap.gov/datasets/dae6aa47f9964ef18521c0edae73ffed_0,https://www.nebraskamap.gov/datasets/dae6aa47f9964ef18521c0edae73ffed_0.zip,,https://gis.ne.gov/Enterprise/rest/services/E_TSpeciesRanges/FeatureServer/0,,dae6aa47f9964ef18521c0edae73ffed_0,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/dae6aa47f9964ef18521c0edae73ffed_0,University of Nebraska-Lincoln,13a-01,13a-01,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,False,False
