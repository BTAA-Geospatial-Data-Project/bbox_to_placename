,Condominium Points,"SEMCOG maintains three separate data layers that represent information on built structures in Southeast Michigan: building footprints, building points, and condominium points. The Building Footprints were the first dataset collected. These were originally developed by using heads-up digitizing to trace the outlines of buildings in 2010 aerial photography. This process was repeated later using 2015 and 2019 imagery. Due to differences in spatial accuracy between the 2010 and later imagery sources, footprint polygons delineated using 2010 aerial photography may appear slightly shifted compared with imagery that is more recent. This dataset is current as of April 2019, and contains only three attributes: the unique building identifier, median height and the source of the footprint polygon. The Building Points dataset is a point layer representing a single point, at the center of the structure, for each building in Southeast Michigan as of April 2020. For buildings with an associated footprint polygon, the building point represents the centroid of the polygon. For newer structures, a point is placed at the approximate center of the structure as shown in recent imagery, as no footprint polygon yet exists. Since it is the building points that represent our most current universe of buildings in the region, this is the dataset on which we store the associated attributes of a building, mainly location and physical characteristics obtained from local assessing data and other sources. The Condominium Points dataset is also a point layer, with each point representing an attached condominium unit located within a building. Unlike site condominiums, attached condominiums are by definition only a portion of a single building, but as each unit can be individually owned they need to be tracked independently. To ensure an accurate match between condominium points and the building in which they are located, the condominium points are placed on the building centroid, and do not represent the actual physical location of the unit.Building AttributesAs stated above, SEMCOG maintains building attributes on the building points data layer. The condominium points and building footprints data layers have only a small subset of these attributes.

Square footage evenly divisible by 100 is an estimate, based on size and/or type of building, if the true value is unknown. Building TypesSEMCOG's building types are based on the 2017 North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS). This system classifies establishments based on economic activity, is widely accepted by the planning community, and used by SEMCOG in developing its long-range socioeconomic forecasts. Each of the 22 nonresidential building types represent one or more entire 3-digit NAICS sector groupings, except for five special types of building that do not fit within this system. These specific types of activity (movie theaters, libraries, dormitories, funeral services, and parking garages) have land use and trip generation characteristics that are different from the other types of activity in their respective NAICS sector and are therefore classified individually. More information on NAICS, including descriptions of the economic activity sectors, can be found at the Census Bureau's NAICS web site. There are also four residential building types, which assist us in tracking housing development over time. Residential types are based on a combination of units in structure, and ownership. Single-family homes and site condominiums typically contain only one unit, but there are traditional duplexes where one owner owns both units, that are also classified as single-family. Attached condo buildings contain two or more housing units in a single building, each of which shares one or more walls with an adjoining unit and can be independently owned. Multi-family housing or apartment buildings contain three or more units, all of which are owned by a single entity and intended as rental units. Figure B.1Distribution of Buildings by Type As seen in Figure B.1, 86.9 percent of all buildings are single-family homes, and only 5.8 percent of buildings are of any nonresidential building type.Mobile homes are a special building type, as we do not receive information on changes to mobile homes in a manufactured housing park through the building permits pipeline. We instead maintain a separate layer of points representing individual mobile homes in parks, updated periodically using imagery to denote if a trailer is still present at each point. Pseudo footprints for these points are generated via code and added to the buildings manually.There are structures that SEMCOG does not classify as buildings. To be considered a building, a structure must contain either a housing unit or a minimum of 250 square feet of nonresidential workspace. Therefore, garages, boathouses, and other accessory structures are not classified as buildings. A description of SEMCOG building types, including the relevant NAICS codes for the type, can be found in Table B.2:Table B.2Building Types by NAICS SectorBUILD TYPEDESCRIPTIONNAICS SECTORSRGB11Educational611190-232-25513Religious and Civic8130-132-16814Governmental921-9280-76-11521Retail Building441-454, 811-812255-190-19023Office Building511-551, 561255-0-031Manufacturing311-339194-158-21532Wholesale Trade423-425170-102-20533Warehouse and Storage493112-68-13741Transportation and Utility221, 481-488, 562204-204-20442Delivery Services491-492156-156-15651Health and Social Services621, 624214-157-18852Hospital622245-122-18253Residential Care Facility623137-68-10161Leisure Activity711-713137-205-10263Hotel and Motel721209-255-11565Eating and Drinking72285-255-071Agricultural111-213255-255-081Single-Family HousingResidential255-211-12782Attached Condo BuildingResidential230-152-083Multi-Family ApartmentResidential137-112-6884Mobile HomeResidential137-68-6891Movie Theater51213168-0-092Library519120-197-25593Dormitory Quarters7213192-137-6894Funeral Services81220255-127-12795Parking Garage8129378-78-78The RGB color values match SEMCOG's typical map symbology for building types.Relationship between Buildings LayersCounty land parcel layers are used to assign the unique APN (Assessor Parcel Number), as well as parcel identifier, to each structure located on a parcel by means of spatial intersection between the parcels and buildings layers. However, there are counties which do not represent parcel splits in their parcel layer when large vacant parcels are developed into single-family subdivisions. In these cases, the polygon geometry of the original parent parcel is cloned once for each new child parcel. A geospatial intersection of buildings to parcels in this situation would lead to each building in the subdivision being assigned to whichever parcel polygon happened to be sitting on top of the stack of cloned parcels. In these cases we use other sources, such as building permits and developer site plans, to identify the APN of each new building, and then assign the parcel identifier by finding the land parcel with that APN. Figure B.2Primary Key Relationship of Buildings LayersLand ParcelsBuilding FootprintsBuilding PointsCondominium Pointsparcel_id (unique) ----->parcel_id --------------->parcel_id --------------->parcel_idbuilding_id (unique) --->building_id (unique) --->building_idAPN (unique) ---------->APN -------------------->APN -------------------->APN (unique)condo_id (unique)The APN and parcel identifier are passed to each building on a parcel, with each building assigned a unique building identifier. Since building points are the centroid of building footprints, they share the same building identifier as they reference the same structure. Condominium records are assigned a unique condo identifier, and also the building identifier of the structure they are located within. By this process, each layer has a unique identifier, and can be related to the larger parent geography as needed.Last Update: 01/05/2021",English,Southeast Michigan Council of Governments,State of Michigan,Geospatial data,,Condominiums|BuildingFootprints|Buildings|Condos,2020-06-24T15:39:49.000Z,,,,"Monroe County, Michigan|Wayne County, Michigan|Oakland County, Michigan|Macomb County, Michigan|Michigan","-84.0775,41.7181,-82.4174,43.1329",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a7a87f76d667497e86321812dd18808f_0,https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a7a87f76d667497e86321812dd18808f_0.zip,,https://services1.arcgis.com/xUx8EjNc6egUPYWh/arcgis/rest/services/land_gisview_terra_condos_2020/FeatureServer/0,,a7a87f76d667497e86321812dd18808f_0,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/a7a87f76d667497e86321812dd18808f_0,Michigan State University,06a-01,06a-01,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,False,False

,MDOT SHA Roadway Centerline,"Esri ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Hosted Feature Layer for accessing the MDOT SHA Roadway Centerline data product.MDOT SHA Roadway Centerline data consists of linear geometric features which represent the street centerline for roadways throughout the State of Maryland. The centerline represents the geographic location on the roadway between both shoulders (physical center), which often but not always coincides with the center painted line dividing bi-directional travel lanes. Roadway Centerline data plays an important role in transportation management and planning, while also being the basis for all other roadway-related data products.MDOT SHA Roadway Centerline data is the end product of a statewide data sharing process between the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), county governments and local municipal governments. Using a common centerline allows for better exchange of information related to the roadway system and provides opportunities for more efficient collection of information about roadway assets. Some centerlines were created in-house using imagery, GPS data, and MDOT SHA's Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) database and others were received from county governments and updated in house using imagery, GPS data and MDOT SHA's HPMS database. The Centerline data includes annual HPMS updates / improvements submitted to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).MDOT SHA Roadway Centerline data is needed for emergency response and management, routing buses and other vehicles, planning for land use and transportation needs, continuity of roadway data and display at county boundaries leading to the same ""look and feel"" across jurisdictions, tracking assets on and along the roadway network, producing maps at various scales, and numerous other applications. There are opportunities to make these processes more efficient, and this program addresses a shared foundation to solve some of these issues. This data is also used by various business units throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies.MDOT SHA Roadway Centerline data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2019.Last Updated: July 2020 (07/22/20)For more information about each attribute field, please review theMDOT SHA Roadway Centerline -Data DictionaryFor more information, contact MDOT SHA OIT Enterprise Information Services:Email:GIS@mdot.maryland.gov",English,Maryland SHA,State of Maryland,Geospatial data,,Centerline|Centerlines|RouteCenterline|CenterlineRoutes|RoadCenterline|RoadwayCenterline|MarylandDepartmentofTransportation|MDOT|MarylandDepartmentofTransportationStateHighwayAdministration|MDOTSHA|OfficeoPlanning&PreliminaryEngineering|OPPE|DataServicesDivision|DSD|MDOTSHAOITEnterpriseInformationServices|2019,2020-08-08T00:26:50.000Z,,,,Maryland,"-79.4862,37.9294,-75.0011,39.7331",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/2987f3dfbd834001b60ded2475b50c26_0,https://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/2987f3dfbd834001b60ded2475b50c26_0.zip,,https://services.arcgis.com/njFNhDsUCentVYJW/arcgis/rest/services/MDOT_SHA_Roadway_Centerline/FeatureServer/0,,2987f3dfbd834001b60ded2475b50c26_0,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/2987f3dfbd834001b60ded2475b50c26_0,University of Maryland,04a-01,04a-01,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,False,False
,Maryland Archived Submerged Aquatic Vegetation - SAV 2018,"The 2018 Chesapeake Bay SAV Coverage was mapped from digital multispectral imagery with a 25cm GSD to assess water quality in the Bay. Each area of SAV was interpreted from the rectified imagry and classified into one of four density classes by the percentage of cover. The SAV beds were entered into an SDE GIS fetaure class using the quality control procedures documented below. The dataset contains all SAV areas that were identified from the areas flown. Some areas that are presumed to contain no SAV were not flown. Some small beds, particularly along narrow tributaries may not have been distinguishable on the aerial photography.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, seeAccuracy of the Data). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.Data Processing Notes:This layer is updated automatically when the most current vintage of ACS data is released each year, usually in December.

,Threatened and Endangered Species Ranges,"This data is showing the current ranges in Nebraska for the species listed as threatened or endangered in the state. This version supersedes all previously dated versions. Updates are made to the shapefile as new information becomes available, and periodically updated maps are posted to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission website. A range map is a generalized representation of the distribution of a species. A species might occur anywhere within a mapped range in which there is suitable habitat. These maps show current ranges rather than historical ranges. Thus an area in which a given species formerly occurred is not included if there is a high degree of confidence on the part of NGPC biologists that the species no longer occurs there. Species, particularly those highly mobile such as birds, may occur outside of their range in locations in which the species is generally described as 'accidental' or 'vagrant.' Range maps do not include such locations. Species may also occur outside the range if the range has changed since the time it was last updated.",English,State of Nebraska,State of Nebraska,Geospatial data,,Biota|Nebraska|SpeciesRanges|At-Risk,2020-12-31T17:44:00.000Z,,,,Nebraska,"-104.2273,39.8910,-95.0993,43.1123",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://www.nebraskamap.gov/datasets/dae6aa47f9964ef18521c0edae73ffed_0,https://www.nebraskamap.gov/datasets/dae6aa47f9964ef18521c0edae73ffed_0.zip,,https://gis.ne.gov/Enterprise/rest/services/E_TSpeciesRanges/FeatureServer/0,,dae6aa47f9964ef18521c0edae73ffed_0,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/dae6aa47f9964ef18521c0edae73ffed_0,University of Nebraska-Lincoln,13a-01,13a-01,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,False,False

,Public Health Departments,"State and Local Public Health Departments in the United States Governmental public health departments are responsible for creating and maintaining conditions that keep people healthy. A local health department may be locally governed, part of a region or district, be an office or an administrative unit of the state health department, or a hybrid of these. Furthermore, each community has a unique ""public health system"" comprising individuals and public and private entities that are engaged in activities that affect the public's health. (Excerpted from the Operational Definition of a functional local health department, National Association of County and City Health Officials, November 2005) Please reference http://www.naccho.org/topics/infrastructure/accreditation/upload/OperationalDefinitionBrochure-2.pdf for more information. Facilities involved in direct patient care are intended to be excluded from this dataset; however, some of the entities represented in this dataset serve as both administrative and clinical locations. This dataset only includes the headquarters of Public Health Departments, not their satellite offices. Some health departments encompass multiple counties; therefore, not every county will be represented by an individual record. Also, some areas will appear to have over representation depending on the structure of the health departments in that particular region. Town health officers are included in Vermont and boards of health are included in Massachusetts. Both of these types of entities are elected or appointed to a term of office during which they make and enforce policies and regulations related to the protection of public health. Visiting nurses are represented in this dataset if they are contracted through the local government to fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the local health organization. Since many town health officers in Vermont work out of their personal homes, TechniGraphics represented these entities at the town hall. This is denoted in the [DIRECTIONS] field. Effort was made by TechniGraphics to verify whether or not each health department tracks statistics on communicable diseases. Records with ""-DOD"" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. ""#"" and ""*"" characters were automatically removed from standard HSIP fields populated by TechniGraphics. Double spaces were replaced by single spaces in these same fields. At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. At the request of NGA, all diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] field.

Licensed beds for Health Systems are equal to the total number of licensed beds of individual Hospitals within a given Health System.Number of Staffed Beds: is defined as an ""adult bed, pediatric bed, birthing room, or newborn ICU bed (excluding newborn bassinets) maintained in a patient care area for lodging patients in acute, long term, or domiciliary areas of the hospital."" Beds in labor room, birthing room, post-anesthesia, postoperative recovery rooms, outpatient areas, emergency rooms, ancillary departments, nurses and other staff residences, and other such areas which are regularly maintained and utilized for only a portion of the stay of patients (primarily for special procedures or not for inpatient lodging) arenottermed a bed for these purposes. Definitive Healthcare sources Staffed Bed data from the Medicare Cost Report or Proprietary Research as needed.As with all Medicare Cost Report metrics, this number is self-reported by providers. Staffed beds for Health Systems are equal to the total number of staffed beds of individual Hospitals within a given Health System. Total number of staffed beds in the US should exclude Hospital Systems to avoid double counting. ICU beds are likely to follow the same logic as a subset of Staffed beds.Number of ICU Beds -ICU (Intensive Care Unit) Beds: are qualified ICU based on definitions byCMS, Section 2202.7, 22-8.2. These beds include ICU beds, psychiatric ICU beds, and Detox ICU beds.Adult ICU Beds (Legacy):In an emergency situation, hospitals may use additional intensive care beds to supplement an influx of patients. This number consists of all ICU beds,burn ICU beds, surgical ICU beds, or trauma ICU beds minus any pediatric,premature or neonatal ICU beds.Pediatric ICU Beds: area combination of neonatal, pediatric and premature ICU beds.Average Ventilator Usage: is the average number of patients on a ventilator per week based on an analysis of 2016-2019 Medicare & commercial claims volumes by Definitive Healthcare.Bed Utilization Rate: is calculated based on metrics from the Medicare Cost Report: Bed Utilization Rate = Total Patient Days (excluding nursery days)/Bed Days AvailablePotential Increase in Bed Capacity:This metric is computed by subtracting""Number of Staffed Beds fromNumber of Licensed beds"" (Licensed Beds - Staffed Beds).This would provide insights into scenario planning for when staff can be shifted around to increase available bed capacity as needed. Hospital Definition: Definitive Healthcare defines a hospital as a healthcare institution providing inpatient, therapeutic, or rehabilitation services under the supervision of physicians. In order for a facility to be considered a hospital it must provide inpatient care. Hospital types are defined by the last four digits of the hospital's Medicare Provider Number. If the hospital does not have a Medicare Provider Number, Definitive Healthcare determines the Hospital type by proprietary research.Hospital Types: Short Term Acute Care Hospital (STAC)o Provides inpatient care and other services for surgery, acute medical conditions, or injurieso Patients care can be provided overnight, and average length of stay is less than 25 days Critical Access Hospital (CAH)o 25 or fewer acute care inpatient bedso Located more than 35 miles from another hospitalo Annual average length of stay is 96 hours or less for acute care patientso Must provide 24/7 emergency care serviceso Designation by CMS to reduce financial vulnerability of rural hospitals and improve access to healthcare Religious Non-Medical Health Care Institutionso Provide nonmedical health care items and services to people who need hospital or skilled nursing facility care, but for whom that care would be inconsistent with their religious beliefs Long Term Acute Care Hospitalso Average length of stay is more than 25 dayso Patients are receiving acute care - services often include respiratory therapy, head trauma treatment, and pain management Rehabilitation Hospitalso Specializes in improving or restoring patients' functional abilities through therapies Children's Hospitalso Majority of inpatients under 18 years old Psychiatric Hospitalso Provides inpatient services for diagnosis and treatment of mental illness 24/7o Under the supervision of a physician Veteran's Affairs (VA) Hospitalo Responsible for the care of war veterans and other retired military personnelo Administered by the U.S. VA, and funded by the federal government Department of Defense (DoD) Hospitalo Provides care for military service people (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard), their dependents, and retirees (not all military service retirees are eligible for VA services)For more information please visit -https://www.definitivehc.com/- or contactsales@definitivehc.com",English,Definitive Healthcare,Esri,Geospatial data,,DefinitiveHealthcare|licensedbeds|Hospitalstaffedbeds|ICUbeds|COVID-19|COVID-19Response,2020-03-19T01:31:54.000Z,,,,United States,"-170.6858,-14.2902,145.7242,71.2989",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,http://coronavirus-resources.esri.com/datasets/1044bb19da8d4dbfb6a96eb1b4ebf629_0,http://coronavirus-resources.esri.com/datasets/1044bb19da8d4dbfb6a96eb1b4ebf629_0.zip,,https://services7.arcgis.com/LXCny1HyhQCUSueu/arcgis/rest/services/Definitive_Healthcare_USA_Hospital_Beds/FeatureServer/0,,1044bb19da8d4dbfb6a96eb1b4ebf629_0,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/1044bb19da8d4dbfb6a96eb1b4ebf629_0,,99-1000,99-1000,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,False,False

,Chmura CVI Counties April 2020,"What is the COVID-19 Economic Vulnerability Index?The COVID-19 Vulnerability Index (CVI) is a measurement of the negative impact that the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis can have on employment based upon a region's mix of industries. For example, accommodation and food services are projected to lose more jobs as a result of the coronavirus (in the neighborhood of 50%) compared with utilities and healthcare (with none or little expected job contraction).An average Vulnerability Index score is 100, representing the average job loss expected in the United States. Higher scores indicate the degree to which job losses may be greater ?? an index score of 200, for example, means the rate of job loss can be twice as large as the national average. Conversely, an index score of 50 would mean a possible job loss of half the national average. Regions heavily dependent on tourism with relatively high concentrations of leisure and hospitality jobs, for example, are likely to have high index scores.The Vulnerability Index only measures the impact potential related to the mix of industry employment. The index does not take into account variation due to a region's rate of virus infection, nor does it factor in local government's policies in reaction to the virus. For more detail, please seethis description.MethodologyThe index is based on a model of potential job losses due to the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. Expected employment losses at the subsector level are based upon inputs which include primary research on expert testimony; news reports for key industries such as hotels, restaurants, retail, and transportation; preliminary release of unemployment claims; and the latest job postings data from Chmura's RTI database.The forecast model, based on conditions as of March 23, 2020, assumes employment in industries in each county/region would change at a similar rate as employment in national industries. The projection estimates that the United States could lose 15.0 million jobs due to COVID-19, with over half of the jobs lost in hotels, food services, and entertainment industries.Contact Chmurafor further details.",English,Esri Business Team,Esri,Geospatial data,,Chmura|COVID19|VulnerabilityIndex|Jobs|Economy|Employment,2020-04-16T15:16:26.000Z,,,,United States,"-179.1473,18.9117,-66.9501,71.3896",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,http://coronavirus-resources.esri.com/datasets/92e56e1f6bc24d5190a4b36f3ce2ee5a_0,http://coronavirus-resources.esri.com/datasets/92e56e1f6bc24d5190a4b36f3ce2ee5a_0.zip,,https://services1.arcgis.com/yfahUFAYAdeS5rmM/arcgis/rest/services/pOGjU/FeatureServer/0,,92e56e1f6bc24d5190a4b36f3ce2ee5a_0,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/92e56e1f6bc24d5190a4b36f3ce2ee5a_0,,99-1000,99-1000,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,False,False

A continuum of care system is designed to address the critical problem of homelessness through a coordinated community-based process of identifying needs and building a system to address those needs. The approach is predicated on the understanding that homelessness is not caused merely by a lack of shelter, but involves a variety of underlying, unmet needs - physical, economic, and social. Funds are granted based on the competition following the Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA). The Point-in-Time (PIT) count is a count of sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons on a single night in January.

,Urgent Care Facilities,"Urgent Care Facilities Urgent care is defined as the delivery of ambulatory medical care outside of a hospital emergency department on a walk-in basis without a scheduled appointment. (Source: Urgent Care Association of America) The Urgent Care dataset consists of any location that is capable of providing emergency medical care and must provide emergency medical treatment beyond what can normally be provided by an EMS unit, must be able to perform surgery, or must be able to provide recuperative care beyond what is normally provided by a doctor's office. In times of emergency, the facility must be able to accept patients from the general population or patients from a significant subset of the general population (e.g., children). Florida and Arizona license Urgent Care facilities within their state. However, the criteria for licensing and the criteria for inclusion in this dataset do not appear to be the same. For these two states, this dataset contains entities that fit TGS' criteria for an Urgent Care facility but may not be licensed as Urgent Care by the state. During processing, TGS found that this is a rapidly changing industry. Although TGS intended for all Urgent Care facilities to be included in this dataset, the newest facilities may not be included. Entities that are excluded from this dataset are administrative offices, physician offices, workman compensation facilities, free standing emergency rooms, and hospitals. Urgent Care facilities that are operated by and co-located with a hospital are also excluded because the locations are included in the hospital dataset. ID# 10194253 is a ""mobile"" urgent care center that provides urgent care to private residences. This entity is plotted at its administrative building. Records with ""-DOD"" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries.

These definitions were set by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Policy Board in December 1998 and are the basis for defining the category and the additional service types for each VHA service site. These definitions cover sites generally owned by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with the exception of leased and contracted community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs). 1. VA HOSPITAL: an institution (health care site) that is owned, staffed and operated by VA and whose primary function is to provide inpatient services. NOTE: Each geographically unique inpatient division of an integrated facility is counted as a separate hospital. 2. VA RESIDENTIAL REHABILITATION TREATMENT PROGRAM (RRTP): provides comprehensive health and social services in a VA facility for eligible veterans who are ambulatory and do not require the level of care provided in nursing homes. 3. VA NURSING HOME CARE UNITS (NHCU): provides care to individuals who are not in need of hospital care, but who require nursing care and related medical or psychosocial services in an institutional setting. VA NHCUs are facilities designed to care for patients who require a comprehensive care management system coordinated by an interdisciplinary team. Services provided include nursing, medical, rehabilitative, recreational, dietetic, psychosocial, pharmaceutical, radiological, laboratory, dental and spiritual. 4. VA OUTPATIENT CLINICS: a. Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC): a VA-operated, VA-funded, or VA-reimbursed health care facility or site geographically distinct or separate from a parent medical facility. This term encompasses all types of VA outpatient clinics, except hospital-based, independent and mobile clinics. Satellite, community-based, and outreach clinics have been redefined as CBOCs. Technically, CBOCs fall into four Categories, which are: > (i) VA-owned. A CBOC that is owned and staffed by VA. > (ii) Leased. A CBOC where the space is leased (contracted), but is staffed by VA. NOTE: This includes donated space staffed by VA. > (iii) Contracted. A CBOC where the space and the staff are not VA. This is typically a Healthcare Management Organization (HMO)-type provided where multiple sites can be associated with a single station identifier. > (iv) Not Operational. A CBOC which has been approved by Congress, but has not yet begun operating. b. Hospital-Based Outpatient Clinic: outpatient clinic functions located at a hospital. c. Independent Outpatient Clinic: a full-time, self-contained, freestanding, ambulatory care clinic that has no management, program, or fiscal relationship to a VA medical facility. Primary and specialty health care services are provided in an outpatient setting. 5. VET CENTER: Provides professional readjustment counseling, community education, outreach to special populations, brokering of services with community agencies, and access to links between the veteran and VA. 6. VA MEDICAL CENTER (VAMC): a medical center is a unique VA site of care providing two or more types of services that reside at a single physical site location. The services provided are the primary service as tracked in the VHA Site Tracking (VAST) (i.e., VA Hospital, Nursing Home, Domiciliary, independent outpatient clinic (IOC), hospital-based outpatient clinic (HBOC), and CBOC). The definition of VA medical center does not include the Vet Centers as an identifying service. This dataset is based upon GFI data received from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).

,School District Boundaries - Current,"The National Center for Education Statistics' (NCES) Education Demographic and Geographic Estimate (EDGE) program develops annually updated school district boundary composite files that include public elementary, secondary, and unified school district boundaries clipped to the U.S. shoreline. School districts are single-purpose administrative units designed by state and local officials to organize and provide public education for local residents. District boundaries are collected for NCES by the U.S. Census Bureau to support educational research and program administration, and the boundaries are essential for constructing district-level estimates of the number of children in poverty. The Census Bureau's School District Boundary Review program (SDBR) (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sdrp.html) obtains the boundaries, names, and grade ranges from state officials, and integrates these updates into Census TIGER. Census TIGER boundaries include legal maritime buffers for coastal areas by default, but the NCES composite file removes these buffers to facilitate broader use and cleaner cartographic representation.

,Tract,"This layer shows disability status by sex and age group.This is shown by tract, county, and state boundaries.This service is updated annually to contain the most currently released American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year data, and contains estimates and margins of error. There are also additional calculated attributes related to this topic, which can be mapped or used within analysis. This layer is symbolized to show the percentage of elderly (65+) with a disability. To see the full list of attributes available in this service, go to the ""Data"" tab, and choose ""Fields"" at the top right.Current Vintage: 2014-2018ACS Table(s): B18101Data downloaded from:Census Bureau's API for American Community SurveyDate of API call: December 19, 2019National Figures:data.census.govThe United States Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS):About the SurveyGeography & ACSTechnical DocumentationNews & UpdatesThis ready-to-use layer can be used within ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, its configurable apps, dashboards, Story Maps, custom apps, and mobile apps. Data can also be exported for offline workflows. Please cite the Census and ACS when using this data.Data Note from the Census:Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, seeAccuracy of the Data). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.Data Processing Notes:This layer is updated automatically when the most current vintage of ACS data is released each year, usually in December. The layer always contains the latest available ACS 5-year estimates. It is updated annually within days of the Census Bureau's release schedule.Click hereto learn more about ACS data releases.Boundaries come from theUS Census TIGER geodatabases. Boundaries are updated at the same time as the data updates (annually), and the boundary vintage appropriately matches the data vintageas specified by the Census. These are Census boundaries with water and/or coastlines clipped for cartographic purposes. For census tracts, the water cutouts are derived from a subset of the 2010 AWATER (Area Water) boundaries offered by TIGER. For state and county boundaries, the water and coastlines are derived from the coastlines of the 500kTIGER Cartographic Boundary Shapefiles. The original AWATER and ALAND fields are still available as attributes within the data table (units are square meters).The States layer contains 52 records - all US states, Washington D.C., and Puerto RicoCensus tracts with no population that occur in areas of water, such as oceans, are removed from this data service (Census Tracts beginning with 99).Percentages and derived counts, and associated margins of error, are calculated values (that can be identified by the ""_calc_"" stub in the field name), and abide by the specificationsdefined by the American Community Survey.Field alias names were created based on theTable Shellsfile available from theAmerican Community Survey Summary File Documentation page.Negative values (e.g., -555555...) have been set to null. These negative values exist in the raw API data to indicate the following situations:The margin of error column indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute a standard error and thus the margin of error.

,Local Emergency Operations Centers (EOC),"HSIP Local Emergency Operations Centers in the United States: ""The physical location at which the coordination of information and resources to support domestic incident management activities normally takes place. An Emergency Operations Center may be a temporary facility or may be located in a more central or permanently established facility, perhaps at a higher level of organization within a jurisdiction. Emergency Operations Centers may be organized by major functional disciplines (e.g., fire, law enforcement, and medical services), by jurisdiction (e.g., Federal, State, regional, county, city, tribal), or some combination thereof."" (Excerpted from the National Incident Management System) The Government Provided Information (GPI) source for this layer contains State and Federal Emergency Operations Centers in addition to local Emergency Operations Centers. This dataset contains Federal and local Emergency Operation Centers and only those federal centers that are of a local nature such as military installations. In cases where an Emergency Operations Center has a mobile unit, TechniGraphics captured the location of the mobile unit as a separate record. This record represents where the mobile unit is stored and if the location could not be verified, a point was placed in the approximate center of the Emergency Operations Centers service area. TechniGraphics tried to verify whether or not each Emergency Operations Center has a generator on-site and whether or not the Emergency Operations Center is located in a basement. This information is indicated by the values in the [GENERATOR] and [BASEMENT] fields respectively. In cases where more than one record existed for a geographical area (e.g., county, city), TechniGraphics verified whether or not one of the records represented an alternate location. This was indicated by appending ""-ALTERNATE"" to the value in the [NAME] field. Some Emergency Operations Centers are located at private residences. The [TYPE] field was manually evaluated during the delivery process to compare the records in which the [NAME] field contained ""-ALTERNATE"". In cases where these values contradicted information that was verified by TechniGraphics (e.g. [NAME] contained ""- ALTERNATE"" and [TYPE] = ""PRIMARY""), the value in the [TYPE] field was changed to match the type indicated by the [NAME] of the verified record. TechniGraphics did not change values in this field if the type was not verified. Records with ""-Department of Defense (DOD)"" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. ""#"" and ""*"" characters were automatically removed from standard HSIP fields that TechniGraphics populated. Double spaces were replaced by single spaces in these same fields. At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. At the request of NGA, all diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics.

,Major State Government Buildings,"State Government Buildings in the United States This dataset is comprised of buildings or properties that are owned or leased by state level governments. It includes buildings occupied by the headquarters of cabinet level state government executive departments, legislative office buildings outside of the capitol building, offices and court rooms associated with the highest level of the judicial branch of the state government, and large multi-agency state office buildings. Because the research to create this dataset was primarily keyed off of the headquarters of cabinet level state government agencies, some state office buildings that don't house a headquarters for such an agency may have been excluded. Intentionally excluded from this dataset are government run institutions (e.g., schools, colleges, prisons, and libraries). Also excluded are state capitol buildings, as these entities are represented in other HSIP layers. State owned or leased buildings whose primary purpose is not to house state offices have also been intentionally excluded from this dataset. Examples of these include ""Salt Domes"", ""Park Shelters"", and ""Highway Garages"". All entities that have been verified to have no building name have had their [NAME] value set to ""NO NAME"". If the record in the original source data had no building name and TGS was unable to verify the building name, the [NAME] value was set to ""UNKNOWN"". All phone numbers in this dataset have been verified by TGS to be the main phone for the building. If the building was verified not to have a main phone number, the [TELEPHONE] field has been left blank. At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results.

,Emergency Medical Service (EMS) Stations,"Emergency Medical Services (EMS) locations in the United States and its territories. EMS Stations are part of the Fire Stations / EMS Stations HSIP Freedom sub-layer, which in turn is part of the Emergency Services and Continuity of Government Sector, which is itself a part of the Critical Infrastructure Category. The EMS stations dataset consists of any location where emergency medical service (EMS) personnel are stationed or based out of, or where equipment that such personnel use in carrying out their jobs is stored for ready use. Ambulance services are included even if they only provide transportation services, but not if they are located at, and operated by, a hospital. If an independent ambulance service or EMS provider happens to be collocated with a hospital, it will be included in this dataset. The dataset includes both private and governmental entities. A concerted effort was made to include all emergency medical service locations in the United States and its territories. This dataset is comprised completely of license free data. Records with ""-DOD"" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries.

Data can also be exported for offline workflows. Please cite the Census and ACS when using this data.Data Note from the Census:Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, seeAccuracy of the Data). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.Data Processing Notes:This layer is updated automatically when the most current vintage of ACS data is released each year, usually in December.

Boundaries are updated at the same time as the data updates (annually), and the boundary vintage appropriately matches the data vintageas specified by the Census. These are Census boundaries with water and/or coastlines clipped for cartographic purposes. For census tracts, the water cutouts are derived from a subset of the 2010 AWATER (Area Water) boundaries offered by TIGER. For state and county boundaries, the water and coastlines are derived from the coastlines of the 500kTIGER Cartographic Boundary Shapefiles.
